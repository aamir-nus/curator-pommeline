### Footnotes

* *** To identify your iPhone model number, see **[support.apple.com/en-sg/108044](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-sg%2F108044%3Fcid%3Dgeneral-iphone-marcom-08062025). For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see [apple.com/sg/iphone/cellular](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fiphone%2Fcellular%2F). Mobile technology support is based on iPhone model number and configuration for GSM networks.
* **Available space is less and varies due to many factors. A standard configuration uses approximately 12GB to 24GB of space, including iOS 26 with its latest features and Apple apps that can be deleted. Apple Intelligence on‑device models use approximately 7GB of space and can be deleted if Apple Intelligence is turned off. Turning on Apple Intelligence will download the models again. Apple apps that can be deleted use about 4.5GB of space, and you can download them again from the App Store. Storage capacity subject to change based on software version, settings and iPhone model.**
* **Size and weight vary by configuration and manufacturing process.**
* **iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are splash, water and dust resistant and were tested under controlled laboratory conditions with a rating of IP68 under IEC standard 60529 (maximum depth of 6 metres up to 30 minutes). Splash, water and dust resistance are not permanent conditions. Resistance might decrease as a result of normal wear. Do not attempt to charge a wet iPhone; refer to the user guide for cleaning and drying instructions. Liquid damage not covered under warranty.**
* **Apple Intelligence is available in beta. Some features may not be available in all regions or languages. For feature and language availability and system requirements, see **[support.apple.com/en-sg/121115](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-sg%2F121115%3Fcid%3Dgeneral-phone-marcom-08062025).
* **All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles and may eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and charge cycles vary by use and settings. See **[apple.com/sg/batteries](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fbatteries%2F) and [apple.com/sg/iphone/battery.html](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fiphone%2Fbattery.html) for more information.
* **MagSafe wireless charging up to 25W with 30W adapter or higher. Testing conducted by Apple in August 2024 using pre-production iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus units and software, USB‑C Charge Cable with Apple USB‑C Power Adapter (20W Model A2305) and Apple MagSafe Chargers (1‑metre Model A2580 and 2‑metre Model A3250) with Apple USB‑C Power Adapter (30W Model A2164). Fast-charge testing conducted with drained iPhone units. Times measured from the appearance of the Apple logo as the unit started up. Charge time varies with settings and environmental factors; actual results will vary. Wireless chargers sold separately.**
* **iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro can detect a severe car crash and call for help. Requires a mobile network connection or Wi‑Fi calling.**
* **Data plan required. 5G, Gigabit LTE, VoLTE and Wi-Fi calling are available in selected markets and through selected carriers. Speeds are based on theoretical throughput and vary based on site conditions and carrier. For details on 5G and LTE support, contact your carrier and see **[apple.com/sg/iphone/cellular](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fiphone%2Fcellular%2F).
* **Wi‑Fi 7 available in countries and regions where supported.**
* **Ultra Wideband availability varies by region.**
* **Visual intelligence is available on any Apple Intelligence–enabled iPhone. Some capabilities may not be available in all languages and regions. For more details, see **[support.apple.com/en-sg/121115#visual-intelligence](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-sg%2F121115%3Fcid%3Dgeneral-iphone-marcom-08062025%23visual-intelligence).
* **Use of an eSIM requires a carrier that supports eSIM and a wireless service plan. See your carrier for details. To learn more, visit **[apple.com/sg/esim](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fesim%2F).
* **FaceTime calling requires a FaceTime-enabled device for the caller and recipient and a Wi‑Fi connection. Availability over a mobile network depends on carrier policies; data charges may apply.**
* **Standard dynamic range video content only.**
* **Siri may not be available in all languages or in all areas, and features may vary by area. Internet access required. Mobile data charges may apply.**
* **Wireless broadband recommended; fees may apply.**
* **Data accurate as of product launch.**
* **Product recycled or renewable content is the mass of certified recycled material relative to the overall mass of the device, not including packaging or in-box accessories.**
* **Carbon reductions are calculated against a product-specific business-as-usual scenario as modelled by Apple: 1) No use of clean electricity for manufacturing or product use, beyond what is already available on the latest modelled grid (based on regional emissions factors). 2) Apple’s carbon intensity of key materials as of 2015 (our baseline year for our 2030 product carbon neutrality goal). Carbon intensity of materials reflects use of recycled content and production technology. 3) Apple’s average mix of transportation modes (air, rail, ocean, ground) by product line across three years (fiscal years 2017 to 2019) to best capture the baseline transportation emissions of our products.**
* **Lithium and cobalt in the battery claims use mass balance allocation.**
* **Based on retail packaging as shipped by Apple. Breakdown of US retail packaging by weight. Adhesives, inks and coatings are excluded from our calculations of plastic content and packaging weight.**
* **We estimate the percentage of electricity-related emissions in our manufacturing that is sourced from low-carbon electricity by attributing to our carbon model low‑carbon energy procured by our suppliers in the prior fiscal year, based on the supplier manufacturing allocations at time of product launch. This calculation assesses the suppliers for iPhone 16 Plus with 128GB. Included in this number is only low-carbon electricity that Apple or its suppliers have procured as part of Apple’s Supplier Clean Energy Programme.**
* **Efficiency performance is based on the US Department of Energy **[Federal Energy Conservation Standards for Battery Chargers](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.regulations.gov%2Fdocument%2FEERE-2008-BT-STD-0005-0256).
* [Apple’s Regulated Substances Specification](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fenvironment%2Fpdf%2FApple_Regulated_Substances_Specification.pdf) describes Apple’s restrictions on the use of certain chemical substances in materials in Apple products, accessories, manufacturing processes and packaging used for shipping products to Apple’s end customers. Restrictions are derived from international laws or directives, regulatory agencies, eco‑label requirements, environmental standards and Apple policies. Every Apple product is free of PVC and phthalates except for AC power cables in India, Thailand (for two‑pronged AC power cables) and South Korea, where we continue to seek government approval for our PVC and phthalates replacement. Apple products comply with the European Union Directive 2011/65/EU and its amendments, including exemptions for the use of lead such as high-temperature solder. Apple is working to phase out the use of these exempted substances for new products where technically possible.
* **Trade-in values determined by Apple’s approved third-party partner may vary based on the condition and model of your smartphone trade-in. Offer is only available via Apple’s approved third-party partner, and not all devices are eligible for credit. **[Additional terms apply](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsg%2Fshop%2Ftrade-in).
