### Apple Intelligence

## AI‑opening possibilities.

**Available now in English¹**

**[Image: Hand holding iPhone 16e with colorful glowing edges around the Lock Screen.]**

**iPhone 16e is built for Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that helps you write, express yourself and get things done effortlessly. Create your own emoji, edit a photo with Clean Up and more. With groundbreaking privacy protections, it gives you peace of mind that no one else can access your data — not even Apple.**

#### Boost your productivity

* **Writing Tools** can proofread your text and rewrite different versions until the tone and wording are just right, and summarise selected text with a tap. They’re available nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps. You can even describe a change, like “make this dinner invitation more welcoming”.
* **Priority messages in Mail** elevate time-sensitive messages to the top of your inbox — like an invitation that has a deadline today or a check-in reminder for your flight this afternoon.
* **Just hit record in the Notes or Phone app to capture audio recordings and transcripts. Apple Intelligence generates **summaries** of your transcripts, so you can get the most important info at a glance.**

#### Express yourself visually

* **Make a **Genmoji** directly in the keyboard to match any conversation. Want to create a chicken with a backpack? You got it. Just provide a description.**
* **The **Image Playground app** lets you create unique images in distinct styles based on a description, a concept or even a person from your Photos library. Experiment with image styles like animation, illustration and sketch.⁶**
* **Image Wand** can transform your rough sketch into a polished image in the Notes app. Use your finger to draw a circle around your sketch or simply circle an empty space, and Image Wand analyses the content around it to produce a complementary visual.
* **With **Clean Up**, you can remove distracting background objects from your photos with just a tap — so you can perfect a shot while staying true to the original image.⁷**

#### The start of a new era for Siri

* **With an all‑new design, richer language understanding and expansive product knowledge about your devices, **Siri is more helpful than ever**. Siri can even tap into ChatGPT to bring additional answers straight to you.**
* **Richer language understanding** and an enhanced voice make communicating with Siri even more natural. For example, if you stumble over your words, Siri still knows what you’re getting at.
* **Not sure how to do something on iPhone, like set a text message to send later? With expansive product knowledge, Siri can give you **step‑by‑step instructions** in a snap.**

### Great powers come with great privacy.

**[Image: Animation of a lock icon with colorful patterns inside.]**

  **Apple Intelligence is **designed to protect your privacy at every step**. It’s integrated into the core of iPhone through on‑device processing. So it’s aware of your personal information without collecting your personal information. And with **groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute**, Apple Intelligence can draw on larger Apple‑designed server‑based models, running on Apple silicon, to handle more complex requests for you while protecting your privacy.**
