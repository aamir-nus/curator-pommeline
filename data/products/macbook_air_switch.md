## You’ll feel at home in no time.

### If you love iPhone, you’ll love Mac.

Mac is designed to be just as easy to learn as iPhone. And when you use them together, you can do incredible things.

* See and use what’s on your iPhone from your Mac without having to reach for it with iPhone Mirroring.¹
* Send and receive text messages from your Mac with iMessage.²
* Copy text, images, videos or files from your iPhone and paste them on your Mac with Universal Clipboard.
* Take a picture or scan a document on your iPhone and see it instantly on your Mac with Continuity Camera.
* Share your iPhone Internet connection with your Mac using Personal Hotspot.

### macOS. Quick to learn. Easy to love.

Simple, intuitive gestures. Snappy, smooth multitasking. Free, seamless updates. That’s thanks to macOS — the powerful, friendly operating system that makes a Mac a Mac. If you’re switching over from PC, you’ll catch on quick.

### Your apps won’t just run. They’ll fly.

When you switch to Mac, you can still use the apps you know and love — like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. And you’ll see just how fast, smooth and snappy Slack, Zoom and Google Docs can be. Mac also easily runs your favourite pro apps — like Adobe Lightroom and Canva. Find these and thousands more in the Mac App Store.

### Makes moving over files all smiles.

Setting up a new Mac is easy. And if you have an iPhone, you’re already part of the way there. Just bring your iPhone nearby and Setup Assistant can automatically sign you in to your Apple Account. It will transfer files, photos, messages, passwords and more from iCloud straight to your new Mac. If you’re transferring from a PC, Migration Assistant will walk you through the process and put your content in place on Mac.
