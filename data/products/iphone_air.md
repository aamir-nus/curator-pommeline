## Design

### So this is what the future feels like.

The all-new iPhone Air is so impossibly thin and light that it nearly disappears in your hand. At 5.6mm and weighing just 165g,⁴ it’s the thinnest iPhone ever — even with a large, immersive 6.5‑inch display⁵ and the power of the A19 Pro chip. It’s a paradox you have to hold to believe.

**Titanium frame.**
A Grade 5 titanium frame built with 80 per cent recycled titanium makes iPhone Air as strong as it is stunning.

**Innovative internal design.**
Multiple technologies are housed in the plateau of iPhone Air, maximising performance and creating space for a large, high‑density battery.

**Immersive pro display.**
6.5‑inch Super Retina XDR display — our best ever.⁵ 3,000 nits peak brightness. ProMotion up to 120Hz. And better anti‑reflection.

**Ceramic Shield.**
Protects the back of iPhone Air, making it 4x more resistant to cracks.⁶ New Ceramic Shield 2 on the front has 3x better scratch resistance.⁷

**Camera Control.**
Instantly take a photo, record video, adjust settings and more. So you never miss a moment.

**Action button.**
A customisable fast track to your favourite feature. Long press to launch the action you want — Silent mode, Translation, Shortcuts and more.

## Cameras

### New front. New rear. New cam-era.

* **18MP** Center Stage front camera
* **48MP** Fusion Main camera
* **4K 60 fps** Dolby Vision
* **4 lenses** in your pocket

An all‑new camera system means you can snap amazing selfies, take incredible portraits and landscapes, and capture pro-level videos.

### 18MP Center Stage front camera. It’s a total frame changer.

The new front camera gives you flexible ways to frame your photos and videos — and so much more. Tap to expand the field of view and rotate from portrait to landscape without moving your iPhone. And when friends join the shot, the field of view expands so you get more friendsies in your selfies.

* **Centre Stage for photos:** An all-new square sensor enables zoom and rotate options, for more flexible ways to frame selfies and videos. And it gets everyone in a group shot — automatically.
* **Dual Capture video:** Record yourself and the world around you with simultaneous front and rear video capture.
* **Ultra‑stabilised video:** Capture stunningly smooth 4K 60 fps video in Dolby Vision, even when you’re in action.
* **Centre Stage for video calls:** Artificial intelligence automatically adjusts the frame, so you’re front and centre for virtual meetings and FaceTime calls.⁹

### Smile. It’s the world’s favourite camera.

With over a decade of hardware and software innovations, iPhone has become the world’s favourite camera. iPhone Air continues this legacy with its powerful 48MP Fusion camera system that works like multiple advanced cameras in one. Shoot in super-high‑resolution 48MP for ultimate detail or 24MP by default, or use the built‑in 2x Telephoto to zoom in with exceptionally clear quality.

### Brilliant photos and pro‑style video? Yes, please.

* **Next-generation portraits:** Turn photos into stunning portraits after the fact.
* **Latest-generation Photographic Styles:** Choose from different presets, including the new Bright style, to customise the tone, colour and look of your photos.
* **Low-light and Night mode photography:** With a large sensor and fast aperture, the advanced Fusion camera system on iPhone Air lets you capture more detail and brighten your shots — even when it’s dark.
* **Pro videos:** Record up to 4K 60 fps videos or enable Action mode for incredibly stabilised video. And Audio Mix lets you adjust the way voices sound in your video.
* **2x Telephoto:** Zoom in on your subjects with exceptional detail.
* **Clean Up:** Remove unwanted objects, people and background distractions from your photos.¹⁰
* **Camera Control:** Take the perfect shot in record time.

## Performance and battery life

### Power in a new light.

* A19 Pro chip
* N1 chip
* C1X modem

iPhone Air was designed to deliver pro performance in the thinnest iPhone ever. Bringing together the power of our latest-generation Apple silicon and the efficiency of the A19 Pro chip, advanced features like Clean Up in Photos, Apple Intelligence or graphics-intensive gaming happen smoothly and effortlessly.

### A19 Pro chip and C1X modem. Hyperspeed. Hyperefficient.

A19 Pro delivers the fastest CPU in any smartphone and introduces our most advanced GPU yet, so you can enjoy even the most demanding AAA games. Each of the GPU cores has a built‑in Neural Accelerator, providing new levels of capability for your daily workflows. The CPU alone is up to 40 per cent faster than the chip in iPhone 14 Pro. And with C1X, the new version of the Apple‑designed modem, iPhone Air is the most power‑efficient iPhone ever made.

### All‑day battery life is just the beginning.

The internal design of iPhone Air was completely rethought in order to maximise battery space. All to say, you’ll enjoy remarkable battery life all day long.

* Up to **27 hours** video playback¹
* Up to **50% charge** in 30 minutes¹¹
