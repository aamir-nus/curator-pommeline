### All 48MP rear cameras. An evolution in resolution.

iPhone 17 has a 48MP Fusion Main camera with a 2x optical-quality telephoto and a 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide camera with 4x the resolution of the Ultra Wide camera on iPhone 16.

And at 256GB, it has **double the starting storage** of the previous model.⁶ So you can capture to your heart’s content — and beyond.
